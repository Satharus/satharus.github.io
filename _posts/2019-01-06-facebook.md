# Backstory

The art and animation styles are amazing and very unique, and although the topic of “Facebook leaking data” is talked about a lot, the video uniquely represented it in a way that I had never seen before.

**Just a little note**: The video contains a little bit of language, you can ignore it if you want and just continue reading the article. I thought it was cool enough to share.

After watching the video a couple of times, I asked myself _“How bad could it be?”_.

# Get Your Facebook Information

Facebook allows you to check your information and download it at any time, to do so:

1. Click on the triangle in the top right corner of your News Feed.
2. Click on Settings.
3. At the top left, you’ll find “Your Facebook Information”.
4. Click on “View”, it is next to “Access your information”.
