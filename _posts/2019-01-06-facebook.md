# Backstory

A few weeks ago a friend of mine sent me this interesting video, I absolutely loved it.

The art and animation styles are amazing and very unique, and although the topic of “Facebook leaking data” is talked about a lot, the video uniquely represented it in a way that I had never seen before.

**Just a little note**: The video contains a little bit of language, you can ignore it if you want and just continue reading the article. I thought it was cool enough to share.

After watching the video a couple of times, I asked myself _“How bad could it be?”_.

How much does Facebook know about you, why should or shouldn’t you be afraid, and what to do?

**Let’s find out!**

# Get Your Facebook Information

Facebook allows you to check your information and download it at any time, to do so:

1. Click on the triangle in the top right corner of your News Feed.
2. Click on Settings.
3. At the top left, you’ll find “Your Facebook Information”.
4. Click on “View”, it is next to “Access your information”.

# What Facebook Has

Just a quick reminder that what we’re looking at here is the data that Facebook decides to show you. We have no idea if that’s all there is to it.

Also, the data I am showing here is from my own personal account that I have been using since late 2014. I just deleted a lot of the data from it recently after downloading it.

The amount of information you’ll find there is huge. My archive was about 3.5 GiB in HTML format with HD pictures.

At first we find the trivial stuff like posts, photos, videos, comments, etc .. Everything that is on your profile is there. Including friends, followers, groups, events, and even profile update history (changes such as profile picture and contact info updates).

Messages, apps you’ve logged in with Facebook, and payment history are also there. No surprises.

Scrolling further, we reach the “Information about you” section, this is where it gets really creepy.

## Information About You

### I - Ads

The three subsections in ads can tell A LOT about you.

Ads interests alone tell a lot, the list is huge and it defined a lot of things I was interested in.

There’s also this subsection, which is also a huge list but I am sharing this snippet.

![advertisersinteraction](/assets/images/facebook/advertisersinteraction.png)

Just by looking at these 3 entries and doing a Google search, you’ll get to know that:

1. I get _too interested_ in fast food around midnight.
2. I am interested in computer hardware. (Or wear glasses)

All of this gives Facebook a “profile” of who I am, despite what I post publicly. It helps them with advertisements.

### II - Search and Location History

This section included my search history, which alone tells a lot about your interests. It also included a location history section, but it was empty in my case as I usually have GPS off on my phone, and I haven’t used the Facebook app since ~early 2016.

### III - Calls and Messages

This section was extremely scary, it had over 1000 calls and messages logged from late 2015 to mid 2016 (That’s around the time when I removed the Facebook app for Android and never downloaded it ever again).
