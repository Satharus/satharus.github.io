I usually like to tinker with low level programming, reverse engineering, Linux, and hardware and stuff. Here's some of the work I am proud of, in no particular order:


- Check out some of my [Bash Snippets](https://github.com/Satharus/Bash-Snippets).
- Full 128-bit [AES Encryption](https://github.com/Satharus/AES-Encryption) written in x86 assembly without using the AES-NI extension. Alongside is the [NASM template](https://github.com/Satharus/NASM-Template) for writing quick assembly programs.
- The not so [chad shell](https://github.com/Satharus/Chell).
- The (forever) WIP GDB interface: [Disass](https://github.com/Satharus/Disass).


Not strictly software, but related:

- [My dot files](https://github.com/Satharus/dotfiles).
- [EOI 2019 Competitive Programming Sessions](https://github.com/Satharus/EOI-Preparation-Sessions) for middle schoolers.
- Open Source Community [FCIS Linux Workshop 2019 content](https://github.com/Satharus/OSC19-Linux-Workshop-Sessions).
